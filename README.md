<h1>Eat Da Burger</h1>

Built as a practice in MySQL and Express, this application stores "burgers" that users submit, and updates the burger status when a burger is "devoured" by a user.

Technologies:

Express, AJAX, MySQL, JavaSript, jQuery, and Handlebars

How it Works
<br>
User submitted burgers are saved upon creation, and fetched on initial load via AJX requests to the MySQL database, then rendered via Handlebars.
